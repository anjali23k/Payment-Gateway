                Mission Education is a project to provide educational opportunities to disadvantaged children. These
                children are mostly either homeless, orphaned, abandoned, runaways, or belong to extremely poor
                families. Many of them have lost precious years of their childhood, working as child labour. At Mission
                Education centres, they are not only provided education, but also nurtured in a loving and caring
                environment, conducive for their holistic growth. The Mission Education campaign aims to reach out to
                the civil society – youth, individuals, institutions to come forward. We can all come together and
                contribute to Mission Education in whatever way we can – by making a donation, by spreading the word, by
                volunteering, or through corporate associations. We believes that every action counts!
